Facebook continue to make themselves impossible to support with their complete lack of morals. Unfortunately, we have sewn a lot of their technologies into our day-to-day tech stacks. The aim of this site is to help you find alternatives to the technologies that Facebook make and also technologies that rely on Facebookâ€™s work.

This is an open source project, so please [do contribute](https://github.com/andybelldesign/npm-uninstall-facebook) where you can.
