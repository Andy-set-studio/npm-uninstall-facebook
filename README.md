# NPM Uninstall Facebook

Facebookâ€™s relentless [abuse](https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/facebook-project-atlas/) [of](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/16/facebook-myanmar-failure-blundering-toddler) [their](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-facebook-influence-us-election) [position](https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-all-social-network-scandals-2018-12#january-2018-facebook-is-slammed-by-george-soros-1) is making them difficult to support. Unfortunately, their products and open source projects have a large impact on our everyday lives.

Some people understandably, want to distance themselves as _far as possible_ from Facebook, so this site provides alternatives to well known Facebook products, or products that are heavily reliant on Facebook technologies. 

It is not a call to boycott Facebook or their open source contributions. People are of course, welcome to make those decisions on their own.
