# NPM Uninstall Facebook

Facebook continue to make themselves impossible to support with their complete lack of morals. Unfortunately, we have sewn a lot of their technologies into our day-to-day tech stacks. The aim of this site is to help you find alternatives to the technologies that Facebook make and also technologies that rely on Facebookâ€™s work.
